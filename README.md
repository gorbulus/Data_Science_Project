## Project Description
Welcome to Team Pura Vida's Wine Review Analysis for the [RMOTR](https://rmotr.com/) Data Science Coursework.  

I will be using common DS Techniques to explore a dataset of Wine Reviews that I found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews). 

## Project Stack

Python has a strong DS stack using the Anaconda IDE in combination with Jupyter Notebooks, and RMOTR Notebooks.

Anaconda comes with the standard Data Science packages already installed, such as:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Bokeh

To get everything running in this project, use ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

## Inspiration & Scientific Method

As an epicurean who has been involved in the Food Industry my entire career, I wanted this project to be related to a culinary dataset of some kind.  The wine review dataset caught my attention because I always had been suspicious of quality and price being directly related in the consumer's mind.  
I think that this dataset offers some great opportunities for sentiment analysis and other text related predictive models. My overall goal is to create a model that can identify the variety, winery, and location of a wine based on a description. If anyone has any ideas, breakthroughs, or other interesting insights/models please post them.


## Project goals

1. Successfully load a csv file into a project.
2. Use pandas and numpy to analyze the dataset.
3. Use matplotlib and pandas to generate visualizations.
4. Create a program to analyze results using Test Driven Design.
5. Use scientific method to provide insightful interpretation.


# Content and Data Source

## This dataset contains one csv file of 150,930 Wine Reviews:

```winemag-data_first150k.csv``` contains 10 columns and 150k+ rows of Wine Reviews scraped from WineEnthusiast during June of 2017.


## Acknowledgements

The data was scraped from [Wine Enthusiast Magazine](https://www.winemag.com/) during the week of June 15th, 2017.


## Dataset Overview

Each record in the dataset represents a single wine review from an online user of [Wine Enthusiast Magazine](https://www.winemag.com/)

The following are a brief summary of the 10 different columns of data included in ```winemag-data_first150k.csv```:

## Data Columns

1. Country  - The country of origin of the wine.

2. Description - The description of the wine's flavor profile.

3. Designation - The vineyard where the wine's grapes are sourced.

4. Points - The number of points Wine Enthusiast  Magazine rated the wine on a scale of 1-100.

5. Price - The cost for a single bottle of the wine.

6. Province - The province or state that the wine is from.

7. Region 1 - The wine growing area in a province or state (for example, Napa Valley in California).

8. Region 2 - (Optional) A more specific region in a wine growing area (for example, Rutherford inside Napa Valley).

9. Variety - The type of grapes used to make the wine (for example, Pinot Noir).

10. Winery - The winery that made the wine.


## Dependencies
To get everything running, use ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
