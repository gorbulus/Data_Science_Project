## Description
Welcome to Team Pura Vida's Wine Review Analysis for the RMOTR Data Science Coursework.  

I will be using common DS Techniques to explore a dataset of Wine Reviews that I found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)

This project demonstrates features of some common Data Science packages to explore a Wine Review dataset found on www.kaggle.com 

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Bokeh

## Content

# This dataset contains one csv file of 150,930 Wine Reviews:

```winemag-data_first150k.csv``` contains 10 columns and 150k+ rows of Wine Reviews scraped from WineEnthusiast durine 2017.

## Acknowledgements

The data was scraped from WineEnthusiast during the week of June 15th, 2017. I will be using the updated dataset that the curator on kaggle added the Twitter handle and duplicate entry issues from a previous version of the data with only 130,000 records.

Inspiration


I think that this dataset offers some great opportunities for sentiment analysis and other text related predictive models. My overall goal is to create a model that can identify the variety, winery, and location of a wine based on a description. If anyone has any ideas, breakthroughs, or other interesting insights/models please post them.


## Project goals

1. Successfully load a csv file into a project.
2. Use pandas and numpy to analyze the dataset.
3. Use matplotlib and pandas to generate visualizations.
4. Create a program to analyze results using Test Driven Design.
5. Use scientific method to provide insightful interpretation.

## Column descriptions

The following are a brief summary of the 13 different columns of data included in the dataset:

- country

The country that the wine is from

- description

A description of the wine's flavor profile

- designation

The vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from
points

- points

The number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100 (though they say they only post reviews for wines that score >=80)
price

- price

The cost for a bottle of the wine

- province

The province or state that the wine is from

- region_1

The wine growing area in a province or state (ie Napa)

- region_2

Sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank

- taster_name

The name of the wine reviewer

- taster_twitter_handle

The wine reviewer's Twitter handle (if available)

- title

The title of the wine review, which often contains the vintage if you're interested in extracting that feature

- variety

The type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)

- winery

The winery that made the wine


## Dependencies
If you want to run tests.py ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
